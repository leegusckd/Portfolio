Python | Optimization | Linear Programming

A modern take on the classic "diet problem" of the 1930s. Developed an optimization model using linear programming to identify the most cost-efficient diet plan that satisfies nutritional requirements. This model minimizes food costs while ensuring that daily nutritional constraints are met for a balanced diet.

In this project, I created a statistical linear model to predict the prices of a used electric vehicles (EV) based on mileage. A random sample of 50 Tesla model 3 vehicles was analyzed using Python and statistical methods. Then, I test the reliability of the resulting linear model using various tools.

Hacker News is a social media platform where people can make posts about topics related to the tech field. This project demonstrates the use of strings, date and times, and object oriented programming in order to determine the type of posts and the specific times in which a post receives the most amount of comments.
