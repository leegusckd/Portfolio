- **Competencies:** Excellent Communication, Customer Service, Public Speaking




## Data Science Projects

**R | Regression | Cross Validation**

A linear regression model predicting the crime rate based on an crime rate data across 47 states in the US. The crime rate of a city was predicted by the model based on various socio-economic factors of crime rate. A cross validation method was used to assess the accuracy of the model's prediction.

**R | Machine Learning | Classification | SVM | k-NN**

Developed a predictive model that classifies credit card applicants as 'approved' or 'not approved' based on several predictors. Used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to create a classifier and evaluate performances of the classifiers.

**Python | Optimization | Linear Programming**

A modern take on the classic "diet problem" of the 1930s. Developed an optimization model using linear programming to identify the most cost-efficient diet plan that satisfies nutritional requirements. This model minimizes food costs while ensuring that daily nutritional constraints are met for a balanced diet.

In this project, I created a statistical linear model to predict the prices of a used electric vehicles (EV) based on mileage. A random sample of 50 Tesla model 3 vehicles was analyzed using Python and statistical methods. Then, I test the reliability of the resulting linear model using various tools.

Hacker News is a social media platform where people can make posts about topics related to the tech field. This project demonstrates the use of strings, date and times, and object oriented programming in order to determine the type of posts and the specific times in which a post receives the most amount of comments.

## JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/leegusckd/Portfolio/blob/main/Images/output-onlinepngtools%20(1).png"> **[Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/leegusckd/etch-a-sketch)**

A fun interactive project in which I recreated a classic Etch-A-Sketch drawing toy as a web application. This project combines the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to allow for Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. Users can interact and experiment with various drawing tools.
