# Project Portfolio - Hyun Chang Lee (James)
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am an aspiring data scientist that is currently venturing through the world of data. This is a portfolio that is a compilation of my projects, skills, and other important learning milestones. I am passionate and committed to learning. I am constantly updating this portfolio as my knowledge and skillsets grow. The main languages that are used in my projects are Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Data Science Projects

## JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Projects

A fun interactive project in which I recreated a classic Etch-A-Sketch drawing toy as a web application. This project combines the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to allow for Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. Users can interact and experiment with various drawing tools and change grid size.
